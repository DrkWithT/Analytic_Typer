# Frontend Notes

### General Design:
 - Use semantic HTML in the page templates.
 - Use material design for simplicity.
 - Pages must be responsive to screen sizes.
 - Use these colors: [Palette](https://colorpalettes.net/color-palette-2283/)

### Pages & Structure:
 1. `about`: This static page displays technical information about the authors.
 2. `history`: This shows version history.
 3. `typer`: The typing test page.

### TODOs: (Worked on by DrkWithT.)
 1. ~~Modify test & timer to only start on keypress for no typing delays.~~
 2. ~~Implement test with letter-word accuracy tracking and highlighting.~~
 3. ~~Implement AJAX to send result data to server.~~
 4. **Fix typer bug 3**: The user still needs 1 extra key press to trigger the result posting AJAX despite all letters typed.
 5. Add `history` and `about` pages later!
